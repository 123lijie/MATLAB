MATLAB
======

The repository contains a few small projects designed to help utilize C++ code in MATLAB. Currently there are some compiler configurations and a class wrapper:
 1. **MinGW** contains configuration files to allow the use of MinGW's GCC compiler's to build MEX files.
 2. **cppClass** contains an example of how to wrap a C++ class by MATLAB MEX file, with a bonus MATLAB class to manage the interface and lifetime of the underlying instances.
 3. **propertySheets** contains Visual Studio property sheets for setting up projects to build MEX files from Visual Studio directly.
